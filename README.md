# Flow graphs for R

Record dataflow graphs of R programs using dynamic program analysis.

The package can be used standalone but is designed primarily to be used in conjunction with our [semantic analyis](https://github.com/IBM/semanticflowgraph) tools. The main use case is analyzing data analysis code written in R.

This is **alpha** software. Contributions are welcome!
