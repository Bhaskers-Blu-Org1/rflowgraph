# Flow graphs for R

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/IBM/rflowgraph.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/IBM/rflowgraph) [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.1401684.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1401684)

**Record dataflow graphs of R programs using dynamic program analysis.**

The package can be used standalone but is designed primarily to be used in conjunction with our [semantic analyis](https://github.com/IBM/semanticflowgraph) tools. The main use case is analyzing data analysis code written in R.

This is **alpha** software. Contributions are welcome!
